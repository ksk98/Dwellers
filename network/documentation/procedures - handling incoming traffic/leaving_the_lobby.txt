PROCEDURE:      LEAVING THE LOBBY
DESCRIPTION:    A player disappears from a lobby if he/she states his/her exit
                explicitly.

A. Client announces abandoning of lobby.

CLIENT:         GOODBYE\r\n
                \r\n

Host is now expected to update the lobby accordingly (see updating_the_lobby.txt, section B).

In case of player disconnecting by closing the appliaction's window, no goodbye is sent. This situation is handled
by catching an exception and removing the player accordingly.
