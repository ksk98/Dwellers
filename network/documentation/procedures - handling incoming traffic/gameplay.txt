PROCEDURE:      HANDLING GAMEPLAY
DESCRIPTION:    After succesfully starting a game, we can now
                finally play the game (yay)!

A. Host tells clients that party is going to the next room.

HOST:           GAMEPLAY\r\n
                ACTION:NEXT_ROOM\r\n
                \r\n

B. Host tells clients that there is no next room, therefore dungeon is over.

HOST:           GAMEPLAY\r\n
                ACTION:DUNGEON_END\r\n
                \r\n
