## About
Dwellers is a turn based dungeon crawler.
Create your character and gather your party
to purge the randomly generated dungeon of
any creature that comes your way!


## Game mechanics
  * Certain enemies are more vulnerable/resistant to certain types of attack
  * Attacks can deal regular damage and/or energy(stamina) damage
  * Every attack costs a given amount of energy
  * A character can rest for a turn to replenish part of energy
  * Players can heal each other thus regenerating health and energy of the target
  * Enemies display certain behaviour, encouraging prioritization of targets
  * The more strength a character has, the more energy it restores during rest
  * Strength increases amount of damage dealt by most attacks
  * Energy increases amount of damage dealt by some attacks
